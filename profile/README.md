## Hi there fellow engineers, tinkerers, designers, product people 🖖

Kranus Health is a digital native medical company focused on men's health. We are passionate about breaking taboo topics and bariers for sicknesses like erection problems.

We do this by building digital therapeutics (DTx) that we deliver to our patients/users in the form of mobile applications. We develop our DTx together with our renowned in-house medical team from the Charité in Berlin.

Some cool things about our first DTx Kranus Edera:
- clinically proven to work! we did quite a bit of testing already
- built with Flutter and available for iOS and Android on phones and tablets
- ever expanding list of FastAPI microservices in production
- feedback loops for patients to change difficulty of training throughout the 12 weeks => so we can also build ML models ;-)
- health assessment at the beginning of the DTx to assess fitness level and tailor the program to the user

We have also started recently posting our new Kranus Health Engineering blog on Medium - it's waiting for your input: https://medium.com/kranus-health-engineering

## Our principles

We have our guiding principles and core beliefs that you hopefully share with us:

1. We believe technology can revolutionize healthcare and enable better journeys for patients and doctors.
2. We do all in our power for patients to “ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages” as stated in the UN Sustainable Development Goal #3.
3. We believe that there should be no taboo topics when it comes to healthcare and strive to educate people about this.
4. We are open and tolerant and ensure that everyone can flourish and enjoy the adventure we are on together.
5. We invest in outstanding people and help each other to become better every day.
6. We are 110% “all-in”, care about what we do and set ambitious goals outside our comfort zone.
7. We take 110% individual ownership of our tasks and each team member feels responsible for delivering our mission.
8. We dare to experiment, test and learn as well as challenge the status quo.
9. We believe in saying “no” so that we can really focus on the few topics that are truly important and meaningful to us. 
10. We act with radical candor, name things as they are and value the best arguments above anything else.
11. We believe in quick and smart decision making, which is always data-driven.
12. We believe in an obligation to dissent, but also know how to disagree and commit to a taken decision.
13. We are 110% committed to the data protection and privacy of our users

## Who are we looking for
